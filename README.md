# travis-test-repo
This is a repo for travis test (pass). In this repo I'm going to build a simple scrips and use travis.yml to test if the script is completing successfully and getting the expected outcome.

- Create a script hello.sh, which prints hello

`
hello.sh script can be found attached to this repo
`

- Create a script test_hello.sh that checks/tests, if the correct output is being printed from the initial hello.sh script, using travis.yml

`
test_hello.sh script can be found attached to this repo
`

- Create a .travis.yml file that will run against those scripts and apply the test at https://app.travis-ci.com/github/georgitsvetkov

`
.travis.yml can be found attached to this repo
`

- Create an account at https://app.travis-ci.com and link your GiT account with your Travis account
